        If you have limited indoor space, <span class="busy">a busy lifestyle or simply want a more independent pet</span>, you might be better suited to a cat rather than a dog. Cats are relatively quiet and are happy to be left alone to sleep and entertain themselves for most of the day – especially if they’re allowed outdoors.

        They don’t need walking, so cats are often well-suited to less active people. They do enjoy social interaction, though, and love being played with. Regular grooming is important too, especially if you have a long-haired cat.

        Cats don’t really need as much indoor space as dogs, especially if they have safe access to a garden. Even without outside access, cats can be content as long as they are fed an appropriate diet and have access to a litterbox, toys and scratching posts to keep their minds and bodies busy. Although they don’t tend to show the boundless energy that dogs do, cats often prove to be more self-sufficient and make loving, affectionate, relaxing and entertaining pets.
