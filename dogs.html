            If you’re an energetic “outdoorsy” type who loves keeping active, a dog may be the right choice for you. Dogs need lots of stimulation, fresh air and regular walks, so they’re best suited to people who have a garden, live in rural areas or have easy access to parks and open spaces.

            Well-trained dogs can be taken on trips and enjoy days out and travelling. Unlike cats, they’re not naturally solitary animals, so they shouldn’t be left alone all day – if you work long hours or have a very demanding job, think about whether you can give them the full attention they deserve.

        <p>
            There are lots of different types of dog breeds available, ranging in size, shape, temperament and hairiness, so you should take these individual differences into account as well if you’re thinking about getting a dog. Ultimately, if you have the space and time, you’ll be rewarded with a pet who is an empathetic, playful, protective and faithful life-long companion.
