            You decide not to join the attack, instead watching your people kill the Whitmans in cold blood. You are devasteded, as you do not believe Dr. Whitman did not poisen the sick, they were just taken by the deadly measles. There is nothing you can do, however, as the deed has already been done, and fury is raging within the community over the death of many.
