                One November night, your tribe, the Cayuse, call a council meeting. You take a break from caring for the sick and gather around the fire to listen in. Joe Lewis, a mixed-race Canadian, fervently exclaims that the sickness affecting them is actually the result of Dr. Whitman secretly poisoning them. Lewis explains that Dr. Whitman wishes to completely eradicate them all by spring in order to claim their land for American settlers. Most of your tribe believes Lewisâ€™s theory, but some, like Stickas, a Chirstian Indian, are unconvinced. Still, those who are convinced seem set on violent revenge, and it is true that in Cayuse culture a false healer is to be executed. Furthermore, you do find it odd that the Indians Dr. Whitman treats end up dying while the white settlers in his care recover. On the other hand, the Whitmans are known for their generosity, as they take in children (even half-Indian ones) no questions asked. A group of Cayuse Indians discuss an attack on the Whitmans...
