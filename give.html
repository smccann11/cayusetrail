            Give the child away to the Whitmans.

            The child is loved and cared for by the compassionate yet stern Whitmans, but over time he forgets the customs and language of your people. Indeed, Mrs. Whitman wrote that she “confines them altogether to English,” and forbids them from interacting with the indigenous people. It was the practice of Chirstian missionaries to discourage all forms of Indian culture, unlike their Spanish predecessors, who allowed a degree of religious syncretism. He would later be taken captive by the Cayuse after they massacred the missionaries, and then sent to live in the lower settlements following the children’s release.

                Disease has broken out in the community. You as the Whitmans to treat the sick, but nothing seems to be getting better. One November night, your tribe, the Cayuse, call a council meeting. You take a break from caring for the sick and gather around the fire to listen in. Joe Lewis, a mixed-race Canadian, fervently exclaims that the sickness affecting them is actually the result of Dr. Whitman secretly poisoning them. Lewis explains that Dr. Whitman wishes to completely eradicate them all by spring in order to claim their land for American settlers. Most of your tribe believes Lewis’s theory, but some, like Stickas, a Chirstian Indian, are unconvinced. Still, those who are convinced seem set on violent revenge, and it is true that in Cayuse culture a false healer is to be executed. Furthermore, you do find it odd that the Indians Dr. Whitman treats end up dying while the white settlers in his care recover. On the other hand, the Whitmans are known for their generosity, as they take in children (even half-Indian ones) no questions asked. A group of Cayuse Indians discuss an attack on the Whitmans...
